            <classification>History</classification>
            <description>Since 2007, compelling evidence has been published in leading scientific journals confirming that fragments of a disintegrating giant comet struck the earth around 12,800 years ago. The impacts set in motion a mysterious 1,200-year global deep freeze that caused worldwide extinctions of species.Are there reasons to question our current widely accepted theories about what happened after that event?</description>
